## Controls

# Features

## Rocket

You can shoot a basic rocket to your opponent, if they are directly touched they'll die but if they are touched by the explosion that happens when a rocket hits something they'll only take one damage, knowing that a player has 2 HP. If they are in the deflagration of the explosion, they'll just be blown away.

## Ult 

You have an ultimate ability, which can be triggered once your bar (at the bottom of the screen) is charged at 100%. You have to press ▲ to activate your ultimate. Once you press it your bar will be put at 0%. There are 4 Ultimates :
- Invincible\
    You can't take any damage
- Invisible\
    You are invisible to your opponent
- NoReload\
    You don't have to reload to shoot
- OverDrive\
    You can't get hurt by your own rockets, a direct hit won't kill you and your reload will be halved
